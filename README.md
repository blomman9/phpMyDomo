## Support
The software is provided as is, and needs a minimum computer expertise to be installed and configured. I won't provide any support by email , phone, tickets, etc...  but if you're offering money, I might change my mind... ;-)

If something doesn't works, look at the code. If the code is missing, well, code it and make a pull request. If you're not a coder yourself, I (or any other developers)  might implement missing devices only if we own the device. We can't blindly support a gear that we can't test ourself.

BTW: Offering me a device not currently supported is a cool and cheap way to say "Thank you", and might certainly encourage me to implement the device fastly. :-D
